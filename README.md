# Motion control firmware for C2000 LaunchPad

Welcome to the firmware repository for C2000 series LaunchPAD running motion control algorithm discussed during ETF's Motion Control Course 22/23.

This repository contains the firmware code for the C2000 series  LaunchPAD, a popular development platform for motion control applications. The firmware is specifically designed to run motion control algorithms on the LaunchPAD utilizing the experimental setup specially designed for the Couse.

The setup consists of:

- RENISHAW RGH24O15D30B - incremental encoder
- FAULHABER LM2070-080-11-C - linear DC motor
- FAULHABER MCLM3006 - motor controller
